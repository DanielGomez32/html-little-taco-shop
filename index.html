			<h3>Taco Trivia</h3>
			<details>
				<summary>When did tacos first appeared in the United States?</summary>
				<p>
					Tacos first appeared in the United States in the late 19th century. The exact date is difficult to pinpoint, but it is generally believed that tacos gained popularity in the U.S. as Mexican immigrants brought their culinary traditions with them. The introduction of tacos to a broader American audience likely occurred in the early 20th century.
				</p>
				<p>
					Tacos grew in popularity over the decades, and today they are a widespread and beloved part of American cuisine. The diverse and dynamic nature of tacos has led to numerous variations and regional styles throughout the United States.
